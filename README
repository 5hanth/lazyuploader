 This ruby script will upload all the photos from the current directory to facebook & Flickr.

for facebook :
 A new album is created with the same name as that of the base directory containing photos.
 The Description of each photo will be the same as that of the file name without its extension.

for Flickr:
 No sets are created. Just photos are uploaded.

 A Thor script (https://github.com/morgoth/picasa/raw/master/extra/Thorfile) is used
 for creating album & uploading photos.
