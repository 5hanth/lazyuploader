Description:

 This ruby script will upload all the photos from the current directory to facebook & Flickr.

for facebook :
 A new album is created with the same name as that of the base directory containing photos.
 The Description of each photo will be the same as that of the file name without its extension.

for Flickr:
 No sets are created. Just photos are uploaded.

TODO:

 Place upload.rb script in your path.
 
 $ sudo cp upload.rb /usr/bin/upload
 
 Now you can run the script in any directory containing photos to be uploaded by 'upload' command.
 
 $ upload

 Move the provided sample .access file to your home directory
 and replace your access credentials in ~/.access file.

 Before running generate_tokens.rb script make sure you have given your Flickr app key & app secret 
 in ~/.access file
